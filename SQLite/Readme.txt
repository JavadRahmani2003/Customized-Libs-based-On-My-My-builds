Please attention to this text!

~~~~~>!!!! BUILDING WITH VISUAL STUDIO !!!!<~~~~~~
if you want to compile the included with this lib, you have to put ALL OF THE FILES FROM THIS DIRECTORY into the include and lib folder into the app.

lib <-> lib
include <-> include 

just this.

Attention: Don't copy the folder itself into the lib or include folder, like: ~\include\include\(All of Build files) No just ~\include\(All of build files)
